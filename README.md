# Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

This project contains a JavaScript implementation of a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate all possible letter combinations that a given string of digits (from 2 to 9) could represent, based on the standard phone keypad mapping.

## Problem Statement

Given a string containing digits from `2` to `9`, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in **any order**.

This is a classic problem often found in coding interviews and competitive programming platforms.

### Example

```javascript
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
